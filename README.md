# Sense and Respond Email Preview Application

## Overview

This project is a **Real-Time Email Preview Application** built as part of the **Sense and Respond** frontend developer assignment. The application allows users to compare and preview email subject lines in real-time. It is built using **ReactJS**, **Redux**, and **Material UI** for the UI components.

### Features:

- **Real-Time Content Update**: Users can input different email subject lines and preview text, and the email preview updates instantly.
- **Multiple Input Fields**: Users can input and compare different email subject lines.
- **Email Preview Panel**: A preview panel simulates how the email would appear in an inbox.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive using Material UIâ€™s grid system, ensuring compatibility with all screen sizes.
- **State Management**: Redux handles the application state efficiently across different components.
- **Authentication System**: The app uses `localStorage` for authentication (with basic login and signup functionality).
